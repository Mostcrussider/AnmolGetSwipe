Welcome to the Custom assignment application.

## Getting Started
- Clean Project
- Rebuild Project
- In- case on VPN and having difficulty build. Disconnect VPN and Re-Build. VPN can have restrictions to download required libraries

## Technology stack

- MVVM Architecture
- Usage of Retrofit
- KOIN
- Picasso
- Jetpack Navigation
- Utils holding the Common utils are other required parts.

## Best practices
- Application being small so easy to modularize, in case it increases in size we can create a Domain layer later depending on project requirements.
- Reformat code before pushing, check for test cases completion and coverage. Optimize functions and code where can. 
- Completion of task takes priority based on timelines. 
- Code quality need be maintained.
- Reusable components can be created
- With every ticket completion -> documentation and test cases need be written too.

## Release flow branches
- develop - development environment
- master - production environment
- release - branch for specific release or hotfix differentiating based on
- feature/ ticket number/name
- hotfix/ ticket number/name
- chore/ ticket number/name
